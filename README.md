### Thanks for stopping by! ðŸ¥³

- ðŸ”­ **Currently working on:** [Destiny2.dev](https://destiny2.dev/) - a collection of API endpoints, built with Cloudflare Workers, that handle all of the irritating parts of dealing with the Destiny 2 API for you!
- âš¡ **Elaborate:** Want to search for a player? Normally, you'd need to setup an application on the Bungie.net website, then build a small client application that calls the Bungie.net API with your API Key in the header, etc. **With Destiny2.dev**, you simply add the name you want to search for to the end of this URL: `https://api.simplify.workers.dev/search/`
- ðŸ˜€ **Example:** https://api.simplify.workers.dev/search/localhost

---

_**Note:** Once the project is complete, the URL from the example above would, ideally, be: https://api.destiny2.dev/search/players/localhost
