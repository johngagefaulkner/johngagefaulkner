# Hi ðŸ‘€

My name is John Gage Faulkner... you can call me Gage. I'm employed as a Cloud Solutions Engineer in Atlanta, GA where I design and build solutions across our enterprise environment of ~12,500 employees and 50+ internal departments. Generally speaking, this manifests itself as something simple like the Packaging & Deployment of either 3rd Party or internal proprietary apps but I also designed and implemented our entire Microsoft Intune environment, including Windows Autopilot, Microsoft Defender for Endpoint integration, and setup/configured the Intune Connector Service on our SCEP server to deploy wifi certificates to our devices during autopilot provisioning. The next project was Qualys (VM/PM) infrastructure setup and deployment but I was then asked to remediate as many vulnerabilities as possible (PowerShell helped me drop the Vulnerability Count in our environment from 2,000,000 (two-million) to ~88,000 in under 1 year (April 2020 to January 2021) before I handed it off to our End-User Support Team. Now, most of my time is spent ensuring our Intune environment is maintained and developing custom solutions to various IT-related challenges faced by users both in the IT Department (i.e., building a Windows 10/11 Desktop App ("AIM Tech Toolkit") to consolidate all the tools our HelpDesk and Desktop Support technicians use into a "single pane of glass" (think: Intune Company Portal but for IT) and users across all our various departments (E911, Police, Fire, Courts, etc.)

## Preferences

I've been programming since Visual Studio 2005 (when I was 12-years-old ðŸ¤“) so I've been with C# and .NET for nearly 20 years now. The list below contains the languages, frameworks, platforms, etc., that I've learned to love over the years:

- **Language:** `C#` (13.0)
- **Framework:** `.NET 9`
- **Design Pattern:** MVVM, Code-Behind (Standard)
- **UI:** WinUI 3 (`XAML`)
- **Databases:** I prefer `Google Cloud Firestore` or `BigTable` but I've worked with:
    - `SQL Server`
    - `SQLite`
    - `MySQL`
    - `PostgreSQL`
    - `Redis` (distributed cache but still)
    - `Firebase Realtime Database`
    - `Amazon DocumentDB`
    - `Microsoft Azure Cosmos DB`
    - `MongoDB`
- **.NET SDKs:**
    - I'm very much in love with the `Windows App SDK`.
- **Scripting:** I've dabbled in a few languages but I'm most comfortable with `PowerShell`.
    - `PowerShell 5.1`
    - `PowerShell 7` ðŸ’–
    - `Command Prompt` (`.cmd` & `.bat`)
- **Web Development:** 
    - Although not my preference (not a fan of web development nor their technologies), over the years I've put in my fair share of time with:
    - `JavaScript`
    - `TypeScript`
    - `Python`
    - `React`
    - `Next.js`
    - `HTML5`
    - `CSS3`
    - `BootStrap 5`
    - `TailwindCSS`
    - `Node.js`
    - `Express.js`
    - `Gulp / Sass`
    - `ASP.NET` / `Blazor` / whatever Microsoft is going with at this moment
